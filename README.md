# Omnik Solar Panels Integration for Homey

This repository contains the code for the Omnik Solar Panels App integration with Homey. The app allows users to monitor their solar panel data in real-time, access in-depth energy statistics with Insights, and create automation triggers based on solar production.

Note that this repository is based on https://github.com/DiedB/Homey-SolarPanels. However this repository adds back support for the Omnik Solar Panels which was deprecated in the DiedB's app.
